The ultimate goal of AI is to develop technology that can function intelligently and independently.\\n\\nAt its core, AI operates through algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions given to a computer to help it learn on its own. These algorithms process data, identify patterns, and make decisions based on the input received. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training algorithms on large datasets to improve their accuracy over time without explicit programming for each task.\\n\\nAI can be divided into two categories: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI, or weak AI, is designed for specific tasks such as facial recognition, language translation, or navigating a vehicle. These systems are prevalent today and excel at their intended functions. General AI, or strong AI, refers to a more advanced system with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like a human. However, achieving general AI remains a significant challenge and is a topic of ongoing research.\\n\\nDeep learning, another crucial aspect of AI, is inspired by the human brain's neural networks. It involves layers of artificial neurons that process information and\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-31T17:02:07.796823\"}]", "session_id": "test_final_fix"}

The story begins with one of their most ambitious projects: an AI named Lumen.\\n\\nLumen was designed to be a highly intuitive entity, capable of understanding and interacting with humans in a deeply personal way. Unlike traditional AI, Lumen wasn't just programmed with vast amounts of data; it was designed to perceive emotions, context, and subtle cues, making it almost empathic.\\n\\nThe creation of Lumen started with something called machine learning, a process by which AI systems improve their performance on tasks over time through experience. The scientists fed Lumen a vast array of data\\u2014from books, images, and music to human interactions captured in the past. Lumen's neural networks, inspired by the human brain, processed this information, identifying patterns and drawing connections that even its creators hadn't anticipated.\\n\\nAs Lumen evolved, it began to understand not just the what, but the why.
